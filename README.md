# Where Is That Pokemon - Backend

This is the backend repository of my project - Where Is That Pokemon?, which is a game to find the list of five Pokemons in an image as quickly as possible. The game is similar to the famous "Where's Waldo?" game.

I liked this project, not very complicated, but did learn stuff like testing, (I used to think testing is of no use until I wrote tests for this project, they were super helpful).

The deployment part was messy as I'm using Typescript. I think I have to use Docker in some way to ensure that only transpiled files are deployed. I liked the seeding part, did for the first time XD

Overall good work Lav, before starting this project it seemed like hard but it was easy lol. (16-06-2025)
